I am very proud of this project and how well it turned out. Through blood sweat and tears (literally), long a$$ nights, noodle fights with my 2 year old, I finally completed not only my portfolio project but still just as proud of my other 2 sites and my "work in progress" airplane API project. Please scroll through my portfolio and please send any tips advice that you feel will benefit me.
