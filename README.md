# MyPortfolio

# https://tanoaportfolio.netlify.app

I am very proud of this project and how well it turned out. Through blood sweat and tears (literally), long a$$ nights, noodle fights with my 2 year old, I finally completed not only my portfolio project but still just as proud of my other projects and dedication to becoming a web developer soon. Please scroll through my portfolio and please send any tips advice that you feel will benefit me. Backend products such as Netlify for hosting and formspree for the contact form.

This is a test to change the readme file and than commit it into the repo on github.
